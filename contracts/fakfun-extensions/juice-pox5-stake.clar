;; title: juice-pox5-stake-ext
;; summary: Lets an ALREADY-DEPLOYED fak.fun smart wallet stake on pox-5 with
;;   the Juice signer, without redeploying the wallet.
;; description:
;;   fak.fun wallets v6-v8 shipped with `stack-stx-juice`, which calls pox-4
;;   `delegate-stx`. pox-4 ended at cycle 140, so every one of those wallets is
;;   holding unlocked STX with no way to stake it. A new wallet template only
;;   helps wallets deployed after it, which is nobody who is already stranded.
;;
;;   The wallet's `extension-call` is the way through: a whitelisted contract
;;   implementing extension-trait, invoked under
;;   `(as-contract? ((with-all-assets-unsafe)) (contract-call? extension call payload))`.
;;   as-contract sets tx-sender to the WALLET, and pox-5's `stake` keys off
;;   tx-sender, so the wallet's own STX locks in the wallet. Nothing custodies
;;   anything.
;;
;;   WHAT THIS CANNOT DO. `call` receives a (buff 2048) and nothing else, so no
;;   trait reference can reach it. pox-5 `stake-update` needs the OLD
;;   signer-manager as a trait, which differs per pool, so switching INTO Juice
;;   from another pox-5 pool is impossible through this path and belongs in the
;;   v9 wallet template, where it can be a real parameter. Every action here
;;   therefore names only hardcoded principals: stake with Juice, top up Juice,
;;   leave Juice.
;;
;;   NO as-contract IN HERE. That would rebind tx-sender to this contract and
;;   stake ITS balance instead of the caller's. tx-sender must pass through
;;   untouched, which is the whole mechanism.
;;
;;   ANYONE MAY CALL THIS. There is no caller gate and none is wanted: every
;;   function acts on tx-sender's own position, so an EOA calling directly just
;;   stakes its own STX with Juice. It holds no funds and has no admin. The
;;   trust a wallet owner extends by whitelisting it is bounded by the fact that
;;   the only contract it ever calls is pox-5.
